After clicking 'Roll Dice', dice will be rolled for player one.
The points he gets from rolling the dice will be saved under 'Current Score' area.
Now their will be two options for both the players when they roll the dice, in the form of,
'Roll Dice' or 'Hold'
If player rolls the dice, new dice points will be added to 'Current Score' area. 
As long as player keeps on rolling the dice, points will be added to 'Current Score' until he gets one point dice.
If he gets one point dice, he loses all of his 'Current Score' points.
So he also has the option to 'Hold' the current points he has gathered before he gets one.
If he gets one, chance will be automatially given to the other player to roll the dice!
Whenever chance is given to other player, 'Current Score' will be added to the existing Upper score.
The first player to reach the 100 points mark, wil win the game of Pig!
Losing player will become the pig! üê∑
